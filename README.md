# Fast-Tracking-Image-Classification-with-Transfer-Learning

## Project Description

This project explores the application of transfer learning using popular pre-trained convolutional neural network architectures (ResNet50, VGG16, and MobileNetV2) to classify images from the Oxford Flowers 102 dataset. The goal is to leverage the feature extraction capabilities of these models, which were pre-trained on the large-scale ImageNet dataset, and adapt them to the task of classifying 102 different categories of flowers. The notebook demonstrates the steps for data loading, preprocessing, model adaptation, training, and evaluation, comparing the performance of the different models on this fine-grained classification task.

## Tech Stack

*   **Python:** The primary programming language used for the analysis and model building.
*   **TensorFlow:** The deep learning framework used for building, training, and evaluating the models.
*   **TensorFlow Datasets:** Used for easily loading the Oxford Flowers 102 dataset.
*   **NumPy:** Used for numerical operations and data handling.
*   **Matplotlib:** Used for creating visualizations, such as plotting training history.
*   **Google Colab:** The environment where the notebook was developed and executed.

## How to Run

1.  **Open the notebook in Google Colab:** Upload or open the notebook file (.ipynb) in your Google Colab environment.
2.  **Install dependencies:** Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. If running in a new Colab environment, you can install them using pip (refer to the `requirements.txt` file in the repository).
3.  **Run all cells:** Execute all the code cells in the notebook sequentially from top to bottom. This will perform the data loading, preprocessing, model adaptation, training, and evaluation of the different transfer learning models.
